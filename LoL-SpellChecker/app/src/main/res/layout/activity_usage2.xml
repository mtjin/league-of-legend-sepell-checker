Hi. Mtjin. I created this app. I would like to thank you for downloading.
If you have time, I would appreciate your feedback! It's written in the Play Store, but here's a quick tip.
The voice and vibrate switches each have a voice and vibration alarm and an alarm sounds five seconds before the spell returns.
And when you turn on the speech switch, you can tell your app that speech recognition works and spells are used as a voice.
From top to bottom=>say! top-tops, jungle-jungles, mid-mids, AD- ADs, supporter-supporters, it will work (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZEK62f2vWg)
You can learn how to use it easily by touching the rest a few times.

2019..5.28 Update: Speech recognition will be done even if you speak 'Pl' or 'fl' instead of 'Su' in the second skill. The second skill is often flash, so I added that it would be more comfortable to attach the
Pronunciation of the flash."/>
